/*
Trying out math operators

// Use all the modern JS goodiness
"use strict";

// Example for a unary operator
let negativeNumber = -5;

// Example for binary operator
let difference = 5 - 3;

// Find the reminder when dividing 20 by 3
let remainder = 20 % 3;

// Raise 5 to the power 3
let fivePower = 5 ** 3;
